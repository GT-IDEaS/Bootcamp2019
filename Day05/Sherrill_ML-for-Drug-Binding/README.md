Machine Learning for Predicting Drug Binding
============================================

In the research laboratory of Prof. David Sherrill, we are interested in
describing and understanding chemical interactions.  Additionally, we are
interested in predicting the strength of these interactions for application
to rational drug design, where information about the strength of protein-drug
interactions can provide critical insight to design better pharmaceuticals.
