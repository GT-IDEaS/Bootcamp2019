    "\n",
    "This exercise was adapted for our bootcamp from [this lesson](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/) of the [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) series of workshops.  In this lesson, we will be exploring the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library for data analysis, by working with a set of ecological data recorded in the Chihuahua desert in Arizona.  Please follow along with this activity by filling in the code cells while we go through this notebook together.\n",

    "## About Libraries\n",
    "A library in Python contains a set of tools (called functions) that perform\n",
    "tasks on our data. Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment\n",

    "One of the best options for working with tabular data in Python is to use the\n",
    "[Python Data Analysis Library][pandas] (a.k.a. Pandas). The\n",
    "Pandas library provides data structures, produces high quality plots with\n",
    "[matplotlib][matplotlib] and integrates nicely with other libraries\n",
    "that use [NumPy][numpy] (which is another Python library) arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't load all of the libraries available to it by default. We have to\n",
    "add an `import` statement to our code in order to use library functions. To import\n",
    "a library, we use the syntax `import libraryName`. If we want to give the\n",
    "library a nickname to shorten the command, we can add `as nickNameHere`.  An\n",
    "example of importing the pandas library using the common nickname `pd` is below:\n",

    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will review ways to explore and better understand the\n",
    "structure and format of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "How information is stored in a\n",
    "DataFrame or a Python object affects what we can do with it and the outputs of\n",
    "calculations as well. There are two main types of data that we're explore in\n",
    "this lesson: numeric and text data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Data Types\n",

    "Numeric data types include integers and floats. A **floating point** (known as a\n",
    "float) number has decimal points even if that decimal point value is 0. For\n",
    "example: 1.13, 2.0, 1234.345. If we have a column that contains both integers and\n",

    "an integer it would be stored as 1. Similarly, 1234.345 would be stored as 1234. You\n",
    "will often see the data type `Int64` in Python which stands for 64 bit integer. The 64\n",
    "simply refers to the memory allocated to store data in each cell which effectively\n",
    "relates to how many digits it can store in each \"cell\". Allocating space ahead of time\n",
    "allows computers to optimize storage and processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data type is known as Strings in Python, or Objects in Pandas. Strings can\n",
    "contain numbers and / or characters. For example, a string might be a word, a\n",
    "sentence, or several sentences. A Pandas object might also be a plot name like\n",
