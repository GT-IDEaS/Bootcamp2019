======================================
A cosmic description of our solar systems' celestial bodies,
to introduce the basics of the [GitHub
workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

### Activity Instructions

1. If you don't have one already, make a GitHub account
[here](https://github.com/join?source=experiment-header-dropdowns-home).
2. [Fork this repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork)
to your account by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right-hand corner of
this page. We'll call your fork `origin`, since you're starting your own contribution
from there.
3. [Clone your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone) of this
repository to your DSVM (what we will hereafter call `local`)
4. Make some changes to a file in this repository by editing it in your 
favorite text editor, like Notepad++ or VIM...
5. Next, commit your changes on `local` by using the Anaconda command prompt.  If you
have a [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) account, you can check out
[this interactive tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) for help.
5. Push your changes from `local` to `origin`.  This can be done on the command line by executing
    ```
    (base) C:\Users\dsirianni\Bootcamp2019\Day01\planets> git push origin master
    ```
inside the directory for the `Bootcamp2019` repository on `local`, your DSVM.

 6. [Open a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)
 to the [GT-IDEaS/Bootcamp2019 repository](https://github.com/GT-IDEaS/planets), what
 we'll call `upstream` (since your `origin` is a fork of this repository, this
 repository is one "level" above your `origin`).
 
 7. Success!

 Your pull request can be approved, returned marked for you to change, or
 closed.  Whichever occurs, the changes you've proposed in your pull request
 will generally be discussed among the development community and repository
 owners and/or maintainers before a final decision is made. Congratulations on
 your first contribution to a collaborative project on GitHub!
